In numerical analysis, the '''Kahan summation algorithm''', also known as '''compensated summation''',Strictly, there exist other variants of compensated summation as well: significantly reduces the numerical error in the total obtained by adding a sequence of finite-decimal precision, compared to the obvious approach. This is done by keeping a separate ''running compensation'' (a variable to accumulate small errors), in effect extending the precision of the sum by the precision of the compensation variable.
